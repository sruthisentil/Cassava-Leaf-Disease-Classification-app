## Overview
This is a simple Cassava Leaf disease image classification web application, using both Streamlit and PyTorch.

## Motivation
This app is designed for the purpose to help farmers with their Cassava crops problem with Data Science. They can just take a picture of their Cassava leaf and use it with this app to be classified if it is healthy or it is infected with a particular disease. That will be important to them to know what kind of prevention can be taken to save their entire crop if it is infected.

## Procedure
  * Train model
  * Install Streamlit
  * Build UI
  * Build Model inference
  * Test Results
  * Next Steps
  
## Model
I have chosen the Resnext50 model to perform classification using the weight of the trained model.
  
## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
